# microcpp

A library for Nintendo DS which tries to imitate the syntax of MicroLua DS, minus the performance drawbacks that come with using Lua instead of C++.

Allows for drawing 2D graphics on the DS by using the console's 3D GPU.

Requires brunni's ÂµLibrary, which has been included here. Just copy the contents of `uLibrary/libnds` to your libnds installation.
